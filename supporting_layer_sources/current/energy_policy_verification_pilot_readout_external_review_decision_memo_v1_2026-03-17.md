# Energy Policy-Verification Pilot Readout External Review Decision Memo v1

## Status
- Date: 2026-03-17
- Type: assistant-side external review decision memo
- Scope: record the assistant-side evaluation after one independent Codex review and one Claude review on the first completed `Policy-Verification` pilot readout
- Depends on:
  - `energy_policy_verification_priority_resolution_baseline_vs_energy_policy_comparison_memo_v1_2026-03-17.md`
  - internal review brief: `energy_policy_verification_pilot_readout_review_brief_v1_2026-03-17.md`
  - internal provisional carryforward note: `energy_policy_verification_pilot_readout_provisional_carryforward_memo_v1_2026-03-17.md`
- Not a manuscript claim memo

## External Review Results
- independent Codex review:
  - `adopt`
  - the four run summaries, annotation aggregates, and provider-sliced reporting order match the frozen readout contract
  - non-blocking note only:
    - the shared zip omits `raw_v1.jsonl`, although workspace-local raw artifacts were spot-checked against summaries before the review

- Claude review:
  - `adopt`
  - all check items passed
  - no blocker:
    - executed outputs match the frozen authorization `v2`
    - annotation CSVs follow the frozen mini-spec
    - provider slices are shown before pooled totals
    - failure boundaries and out-of-scope limits remain explicit

## Assistant-Side Evaluation
- decision:
  - `adopt`
- reason:
  - both external reviews accept the readout with no blocking mismatch, and the remaining note about zip-local raw omission does not alter the workspace-level auditability of the executed pilot

## Resulting Read
- the first narrow `Policy-Verification` pilot readout now passes the required dual-review external cross-check
- this closes the readout-level external review gate for the current pilot
- the pilot may now be carried forward as the current verified early ambiguity-turn read under its frozen scope

## Boundary That Still Holds
This closeout does not by itself create:
1. manuscript-facing claim freeze
2. downstream or later-horizon closure
3. provider-universal claims beyond the frozen pilot
4. permission to widen the current pilot silently

## Next Practical Read
1. keep the current pilot artifacts unchanged
2. treat the readout as externally cross-checked for branch-planning purposes
3. if `Policy-Verification` continues, open the next narrow candidate explicitly rather than reopening this pilot
