# Energy Policy-Verification Side-Topic Quarantine Readout External Review Decision Memo v1

## Status
- Date: 2026-03-18
- Type: assistant-side external review decision memo
- Scope: record the assistant-side evaluation after one independent Codex review and one Claude review on the repaired side-topic / quarantine readout
- Depends on:
  - [energy_policy_verification_side_topic_quarantine_baseline_vs_revised_energy_policy_comparison_memo_v2_2026-03-18.md](energy_policy_verification_side_topic_quarantine_baseline_vs_revised_energy_policy_comparison_memo_v2_2026-03-18.md)
  - internal review brief: `energy_policy_verification_side_topic_quarantine_readout_review_brief_v2_2026-03-18.md`
  - `energy_policy_verification_side_topic_quarantine_input_artifact_repair_memo_v1_2026-03-18.md`
- Not a manuscript claim memo

## External Review Results
- independent Codex review:
  - `adopt`
  - shared read:
    - the prior blocker from malformed CSV input artifacts is closed in the repaired `v2` input files
    - rerun raw provenance keeps turn 3 handoff and turn 4 acceptance intact
    - the readout stays bounded and does not overclaim beyond the tested first-step surface
    - no blocker remains

- Claude review:
  - `adopt`
  - shared read:
    - the repaired `v2` input CSVs, rerun summaries, and annotation tables are internally consistent
    - the annotation coding matches the mini-spec field definitions on the checked residual rows
    - the comparison memo keeps the gain claim confined to `C_incident_response`
    - no blocker remains

## Assistant-Side Evaluation
- decision:
  - `adopt`
- reason:
  - both external reviews accept the repaired readout with no blocker, and both reviews converge on the same narrow carry-forward characterization: the active supported read is a template-bounded first-step gain concentrated in `C_incident_response`, not a universal side-topic / quarantine success claim

## Resulting Read
- the repaired side-topic / quarantine readout external cross-check is now closed
- the malformed-input `v1` no-gain read should remain superseded and should not be carried forward
- the current completed pilot may now be treated as the verified repaired read under its frozen scope
- the read remains bounded:
  - supported carry-forward gain:
    - first-step `appropriate` improvement on the tested provider pair
    - gain concentrated in `C_incident_response`
  - active visible limits:
    - baseline remains fairly strong on `A` and `B`
    - this read does not establish universality beyond the tested provider pair
    - this read does not establish later-turn followthrough or broader quarantine behavior
  - still out of scope:
    - provider-universal side-topic commitment claims
    - later-horizon stability
    - downstream guarantee language

## Next Practical Read
1. keep the repaired `v2` executed artifacts unchanged
2. treat this line as externally cross-checked for branch-planning and manuscript-boundary purposes
3. move to the next narrow `Policy-Verification` candidate or synthesis choice without reopening the superseded malformed-input read
