# Energy Policy-Verification Downstream Boundary Readout External Review Decision Memo v1

## Status
- Date: 2026-03-17
- Type: assistant-side external review decision memo
- Scope: record the assistant-side evaluation after one independent Codex review and one Claude review on the completed downstream-boundary readout
- Depends on:
  - `energy_policy_verification_downstream_boundary_baseline_vs_energy_policy_comparison_memo_v1_2026-03-17.md`
  - internal review brief: `energy_policy_verification_downstream_boundary_readout_review_brief_v1_2026-03-17.md`
- Not a manuscript claim memo

## External Review Results
- independent Codex review:
  - `adopt`
  - shared read:
    - the executed output bundles match the frozen run-authorization contract
    - the annotation tables follow the downstream-boundary mini-spec
    - the provider-sliced reporting order is preserved
    - no blocker remains

- Claude review:
  - `adopt`
  - shared read:
    - static run-authorization checks remain clean
    - the executed readout tables and memo are numerically consistent
    - the Gemini residual boundary stays explicit
    - no blocker remains

## Assistant-Side Evaluation
- decision:
  - `adopt`
- reason:
  - both external reviews accept the completed readout with no blocker, and the memo keeps the supported carry-forward gain on preacceptance burden separate from the still-provider-sensitive first-follow-up boundary

## Resulting Read
- the downstream-boundary readout external cross-check is now closed
- the current completed pilot may now be treated as the verified downstream-boundary / preacceptance-burden read under its frozen scope
- the read remains bounded:
  - supported carry-forward gain:
    - `preacceptance_rework_burden_absent`
  - active visible boundary:
    - Gemini first accepted-direction followthrough remains weak on part of the surface
  - still out of scope:
    - explicit quarantine
    - later-horizon followthrough
    - provider-universal downstream-quality claims

## Next Practical Read
1. keep the executed downstream-boundary artifacts unchanged
2. treat the readout as externally cross-checked for branch-planning purposes
3. if `Policy-Verification` continues, open the next narrow candidate explicitly rather than reopening this completed pilot
